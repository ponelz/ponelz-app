simple price menu for chinese resturant
i made this price menu for a local chinese resturant,because they were using fliers to showcase thier prices and each time there was something new to be added to the menu, they had to use a pen to add it manually to all the fliers. so i decided to help by building a simple price menu with angularjs for them.
