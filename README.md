simple price menu for chinese resturant
i made this price menu for a local chinese resturant,because they were using fliers to showcase thier prices/products and each time there was something new to add to the menu, they had to use a pen to add it manually to all the fliers. so i decided to help by developing a simple price menu with angularjs for them.
p.s this is my very first angularjs app.
